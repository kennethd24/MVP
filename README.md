To help my girlfriend's weekly task to collect video views on TikTok, I created this project as part of Hack Reactor's 2 day MVP sprint. This project helps visualize data trends and gathers necessary data for competitive intelligence. It also has the functionality to toggle display of specific columns and a CSV exporter if further analyses is needed.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React
* Express
* PostgreSQL
* Chart
* Bootstrap
	
## Setup
### Initialize project
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../TikTok-Analytics
$ npm install
$ npm build
$ npm start
```
